# JP-Morgan-s-chase-co-Excel-Skills-Simulation

I just completed the JPMorgan Chase & Co. Excel Skills job simulation. It was a great opportunity to get some insight into what interns at JPMC may work on in.
This one, in particular, was provided by Forage and is completely free. 
Throughout the experience I have learned and followed practical tasks like:

- Excel Keyboard shortcuts

- Conditional Formatting

- Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) Macros

- Data Visualization in Excel

- Data-Driven Storytelling
